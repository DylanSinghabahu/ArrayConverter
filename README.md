# ArrayConverter

Not the best but does <b>my</b> job:planned on copy and pasting word lists online but didn't want to individually quote and space each word to make the array, so I made this. <br>
<i>The use of this is found in the "GamesInOne" repository, where I use this "tool/program" to create an array for my hangman game.</i>
<h2>The converter has two ways of printing an array:</h2>
1. Input one word at-a-time<br>
2. Input a bunch of words in one input <br>
<h2> It also has two options of printing the array: </h2>
1. Curly brackets
2. Square brackets

For example:<br>
Input: sodhfsdhof sdofsodhf oisdfosh<br>
Output for option 1: {"sodhfsdhof", "sdofsodhf", "oisdfosh"}<br>
Output for option 2: ["sodhfsdhof", "sdofsodhf", "oisdfosh"]<br>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
- Delimiter is limited to whitespaces right now<br>
