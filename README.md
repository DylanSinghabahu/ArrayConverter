# ArrayConverter

Not the best but does <b>my</b> job.
Was making a hangman game, which picks a random word from an array full of words, to be used.<br>
The game is included with a multitude of other games in one file, in the GamesInOne repository.
<h2>The converter has two options to print an array:</h2>
1. Input one word at-a-time<br>
2. Input a bunch of words in one input

<h2>Limitations</h2>
The second option works however has current limitations:<br>
- Doesn't remove fullstops<br>
- Account for semi-colons (plan on modifying the delimiter to fix this, however, right now this isn't an issue that concerns me)
